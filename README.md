## 📦 Deployment on Vercel

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Demo)

For testing and demo purposes, the SQLite database will work but data won't persist across deployments.

### Option 2: Production with Turso

For production deployments with persistent data:

1. Create a [Turso](https://turso.tech/) account and database
2. Update your `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("TURSO_DATABASE_URL")
}
```
3. Add `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` to your Vercel environment variables
4. Deploy!

### Option 3: Use Vercel Postgres

You can also switch to PostgreSQL for Vercel's native database:

1. Create a Vercel Postgres database
2. Update the Prisma schema provider to "postgresql"
3. Update environment variables
4. Deploy!

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors & Theme

The kid-friendly color palette is defined in `src/app/globals.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #6c5ce7;        /* Purple */
  --secondary: #00cec9;      /* Teal */
  --accent-pink: #fd79a8;    /* Pink */
  --accent-yellow: #ffeaa7;  /* Yellow */
  /* ... more colors */
}
```

### AI Prompt

Customize what kind of code gets generated by editing the system prompt in `src/lib/anthropic.ts`.
